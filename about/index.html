I also have previous experience in the energy and linguistics industries. I work predominently with the NHS, including NHS Digital and the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.</p><p>I mostly dabble with .NET and React, and have helped develop some pretty cool applications for some pretty cool companies, such as <a href=https://www.airelogic.com/products/aireforms/forms4health target=_blank>forms4health</a> and LTHT&rsquo;s Electronic Health Record system, PPM+.</p><p>These are the things I&rsquo;m really interested in:</p><ul><li>Building software that <em>works</em></li><li>Ensuring the team and its people have everything they need to function well and are happy</li><li>Making products that leave a pleasant taste of User Experience</li><li>Having a good time doing all of the above</li></ul><p>Aside from most of my professional experience being a .NET developer building mostly enterprise applications and customer-, patient-, or clinician-facing applications, I&rsquo;m also interested in other tech too and am embarking on a learning journey in them:</p><ul><li>Golang</li><li>Python</li></ul><p>I build this website with using <a href=https://hugo.io/ target=_blank>Hugo</a>. I did it so I could get a quick intro to Golang. Here is the <a href=https://github.com/nogalskisam/nogalskisam.github.io target=_blank>repo</a>. I also wanted a website I could update super easily with cheap (or free) hosting, that I could also possibly replicate for my other hobbies (such as cooking & gardening). You can read more details in the readme for more details about why I did this and view its progress.</p><footer>made by samuel nogalski.</footer></div></body></html>
