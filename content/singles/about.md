Hello, my name is Sam. I am a software developer and I work in the Health Tech industry with Aire Logic. I also have previous experience in the energy and linguistics industries. I work predominently with the NHS, including NHS Digital and the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.

I mostly dabble with .NET and React, and have helped develop some pretty cool applications for some pretty cool companies, such as [forms4health](https://www.airelogic.com/products/aireforms/forms4health) and LTHT's Electronic Health Record system, PPM+.

These are the things I'm really interested in:
* Building software that _works_
* Ensuring the team and its people have everything they need to function well and are happy
* Making products that leave a pleasant taste of User Experience
* Having a good time doing all of the above

Aside from most of my professional experience being a .NET developer building mostly enterprise applications and customer-, patient-, or clinician-facing applications, I'm also interested in other tech too and am embarking on a learning journey in them:
* Golang
* Python

I build this website with using [Hugo](https://hugo.io/). I did it so I could get a quick intro to Golang. Here is the [repo](https://github.com/nogalskisam/nogalskisam.github.io). I also wanted a website I could update super easily with cheap (or free) hosting, that I could also possibly replicate for my other hobbies (such as cooking & gardening). You can read more details in the readme for more details about why I did this and view its progress.
